## University Enrollment ERD
I designed a relational database schema using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), incorporating key entities such as students, faculty, courses, departments, and enrollments with well-defined relationships. To ensure data integrity, I structured tables efficiently to reduce redundancy. The schema supports queries that retrieve relevant information, such as identifying faculty teaching a particular student in a given term, determining the number of courses offered, analyzing faculty teaching capacities, and filtering data based on specific criteria.
